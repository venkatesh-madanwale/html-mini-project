    <h2>About Mercury</h2>
    <p>
        The closest planet to the sun, Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and has some interesting facts: <br> 
Distance from the sun: Mercury is on average one-third the distance from the sun as Earth, and orbits the sun every 88 Earth days.  <br>
Size: Mercury is slightly larger than Earth's moon and is less than half the size of Earth.  <br>
Surface: Mercury's surface is rocky and covered in craters, with flat plains and steep cliffs.  <br>
Temperature: Mercury's temperatures plummet hundreds of degrees below freezing at night.  <br>
Atmosphere: Mercury has a very thin atmosphere because the sun's heat blasts away most gases near the surface.  <br>
Magnetic field: Mercury's weak magnetic field protects visitors from the sun's radiation. <br>
