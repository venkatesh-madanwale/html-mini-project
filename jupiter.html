    <h2>About Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is so large that if it were hollow, it could fit 1,000 Earths inside.  <br>
Mass: Jupiter is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. <br>
Appearance: Jupiter is known for its striking stripes and the Great Red Spot, a storm that's been raging for hundreds of years.  <br>
Composition: Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning it doesn't have a solid surface.  <br>
Rotation: Jupiter spins on its axis so quickly that a day on Jupiter is only 10.5 hours long.  <br>
Magnetic field: Jupiter's magnetic field is 16 to 54 times stronger than Earth's.  <br>
Rings: Jupiter has rings, but they're difficult to see. The third ring is made up of microscopic debris from three of Jupiter's moons.  <br>
Exploration: NASA's Juno spacecraft has been studying Jupiter since 2016. ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in 2031, and NASA's Europa Clipper is scheduled to arrive in 2030. <br>
