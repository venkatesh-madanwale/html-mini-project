    <h2>About Earth</h2>
    <p>
        NASA has a lot of information about Earth, including its size, shape, atmosphere, and more: 
        Size<br>
        Earth is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest planet in our solar system. It has an equatorial diameter of 7,926 miles (12,760 kilometers). 
        Shape<br>
        Earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges at the equator due to its rotation. The diameter from the North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles), <br> while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles). 
        Atmosphere<br>
        Earth's atmosphere is made up of mostly nitrogen and oxygen, and protects us from meteoroids. <br>
        Distance from the Sun
        Earth is one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun, which is an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). <br>
        Earth's rotation
        Earth's day is getting longer, increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century. <br>
        Earth's tilt
        Earth's axis is tilted at 23 degrees and 27 minutes relative to its orbital plane, which causes seasons. <br>
        Earth's mass
        Earth has a mass of approximately 6.5 x 10 tons (5.98 x 10 kg).
