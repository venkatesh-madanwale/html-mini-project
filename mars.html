    <h2>About Mars</h2>
    <p>
        Mars is known as the Red Planet because of the rusty dust that makes up its surface and atmosphere. However, close-up views show that Mars has many different colors, including butterscotch, golden, brown, tan, and even greenish. <br>
        <b>Gravity</b>
        Mars has about one-third of Earth's gravity, so a person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would weigh about 38 pounds on Mars. <br>
        <b>Atmosphere</b>
        Mars' atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's and is made up of more than 95% carbon dioxide and less than 1% oxygen. <br>
        <b>Dust storms</b>
        Mars is prone to dust storms, which can sometimes cover the entire planet. These storms are often generated in the southern spring and summer. <br>
        <b>Features</b>
        Mars has polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons, and Valles Marineris, the largest valley in our solar system. <br>
        <b>Time</b>
        A day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours, and a year on Mars lasts 687 Earth days. <br>
        <b>Location </b>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and one of Earth's closest planetary neighbors.<br>
